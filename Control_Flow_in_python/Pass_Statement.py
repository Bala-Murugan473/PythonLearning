# pass statement is a null operation, when it is executed nothing happens.
# pass statement does nothing, it can be used when a statement is required syntactically,
# but the program required no action.
# pass can be used to keep class, methods, loops empty

def my_method():
    pass

# Note: if we leave any class, method, or loop empty we will get syntax error.
