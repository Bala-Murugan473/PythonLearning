# Keyword argument: an argument preceded by an identifier in function call
# positional argument: an argument which pass as per the order in the function definition
# In keyword argument we can change the argument order, but not in positional argument

# Both positional and keyword argument functions will have same syntax in function definition.
# it only varies at the time of function call

# positional argument should come first
# keyword argument should comes last
